# SortColumns

For this program, I created a class called SortColumns. It takes a data member called order and it is set to true. I then have a function called minDeletionSize with a parameter A which is an array. It then creates an array of integers called indices and loops through A as it is called. If the length of each index is not equal to each other it then returns -1. I have another if statement and if one of the strings in the array are not sorted or an uneven length, it will return false and that string's index. If the boolean remains true, it will return an empty list since everything is sorted. In the main, I tested 4 arrays of strings, and the first one will return 1 because index 1 is not in alphabetical order. The second one will return -1 since the strings are not of even length. The third array will print 0, 1, 2 because all three of those arrays are not in alphabetical order. The fourth array returns an empty list because they are in alphabetical order.
